#A73

![Preview](https://raw.github.com/tatou-tatou/A73/master/A73.png)

* The gtk2 part is made from [SimpliX](http://sixsixfive.deviantart.com/art/simpliX-346404452), the gtk3 part is made from [Numix](http://numixproject.org/).

* The gtk3 part have some bugs with buttons, but it seems to be the same with vanilla Numix. I will fix them when I can.

* Also, I'm not satisfied with the gtk2 part anymore. I intend to redo it from scratch using only Numix as a base.

In the screenshot, I'm using [those](https://github.com/cldx/Numix) icons. They are not complete and the mimetype icons do not work properly in SpaceFM though, but I might fix that one day. My font is Lucida Grande.
