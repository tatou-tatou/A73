#A73

![Preview](https://raw.github.com/tatou-tatou/A73/master/A73.png)

A gtk2/gtk3 theme inspired by (and initially made from) [SimpliX](http://sixsixfive.deviantart.com/art/simpliX-346404452). The current version was made by tweaking [Numix](http://numixproject.org/) to my liking.

As seen on the screenshot, it's meant to be used with *minimal* window decorations, which means no title bar.

##Misc
The gtk3 part have some bugs with buttons, but it seems to be the same with vanilla Numix. I will fix them when I can.

In the screenshot, I'm using [those](https://github.com/cldx/Numix) icons with the gtk3 file manager [SpaceFM](http://ignorantguru.github.io/spacefm/).
The set is not complete and the mimetype icons do not work properly in SpaceFM though, but I might fix that one day.
My font is Lucida Grande.
