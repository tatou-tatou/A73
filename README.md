#A73

![Preview](https://raw.github.com/tatou-tatou/A73/master/A73.png)

A gtk2/gtk3 theme inspired by (and initially made from) [SimpliX](http://sixsixfive.deviantart.com/art/simpliX-346404452). The current version was made by tweaking [Numix](http://numixproject.org/) to my liking.

As seen on the screenshot, it's meant to be used with minimal window decorations, which means no title bar.

##To fix
#####gtk3
* The gtk3 part have some bugs with buttons, but it seems to be the same with vanilla Numix.
* Anyway, all the gtk3 needs to be reworked.

#####gtk2
* Menus have some very inconsistent padding.
* Is pink a good color for buttons?
* Inactive buttons are pig disgusting.
* Firefox draws red things on both ends of the scrollbar. Have not seen that elsewhere.
* Not satisfied with the arrows.

##Misc
In the screenshot, I'm using [those](https://github.com/cldx/Numix) icons and [SpaceFM](http://ignorantguru.github.io/spacefm/), a gtk3 file manager.

The set is not complete and the mimetype icons do not work properly in SpaceFM, but as the repo seems abandoned, I might fix that one day.

My gtk font is Lucida Grande.
