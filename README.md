#A73

![Preview](https://raw.github.com/tatou-tatou/Themes/master/A73/A73.png)

* The gtk2 part is made from SimpliX. The gtk3 part is made from Numix.

* The gtk3 part is buggy as hell, I will fix it when I can.

* Also, I intent to redo it from scratch using only Numix as a base.

In the screenshot, I'm using [those](https://github.com/cldx/Numix) icons. They are not complete and do not work properly in SpaceFM though, but I might fix that one day.
